    * Data are aggregated to mean (across items/trials)
    if there are >=2 observations per subject and cell.
    You may use Linear Mixed Model to analyze the data,
    e.g., with subjects and items as level-2 clusters.

By default, pooled SD is [3mRoot Mean Square Error[23m (RMSE).
There is much disagreement on how to compute Cohen’s d.
You are completely responsible for setting `sd.pooled`.
You might also use `effectsize::t_to_d()` to compute d.[39m"
